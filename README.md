edhelind
========

**edhelind** is an ELF file viewer tool.


Origins of the name
-------------------

The phrase "edhel ind" is a Sindarin phrase that translates roughly into English as "the
innermost thoughts of an Elf." This is a play on the Extensible Linking Format,
or ELF, being a homonym for J. R. R. Tolkein's Elves, a species of homonid for
which he invented several languages.

A quick search of the internet shows more than a handful of projects called some
variation of "ELF Viewer" so a simple, functional English name is out of the
question.  Reaching out to a Sindarin transation of several useful phrases
related to the inner workings of elves (there are not a large lexicon of Elvish
terms for anatomical structures), I came up with "edhel ind," which can be
mushed together into a pronouncable word, hence *edhelind*.
